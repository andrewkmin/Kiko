I've shot some things over the past couple years. I really thought DSLRs were cool for a while; 
started off with a neat little Sony A200, moved onto a Canon 60D with a very solid 17-55 mm f2.8 IS, and now delegate all my photo taking to my handy iPhone.

Some notable trips: 
* Paris (2014)
* Cambodia (2015)
* Peru (2016)
* Seoul (2016)
* Beijing (2016)

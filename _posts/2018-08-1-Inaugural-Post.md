<p class="lead">It's been a long time coming.</p>
I've been meaning to create a personal site for a while, ever since learning Javascript over the course of the first half of 2017. I wrote a couple posts on <a href="https://medium.com/@andrew_min">Medium</a>, but after seeing guys like <a href="https://avc.com">Fred Wilson</a> and <a href="https://startupboy.com">Naval Ravikant</a> refer to old posts from their personal sites, I found the ability to be able to do that quite tantalizing. For what it's worth, I may revert to publishing on Medium, because their product is pretty dang good. But for now, this site will serve as a brain dump of mine on various topics. By no means am I a great writer, or even a good one. Regardless, I believe writing is a tangible way we can all contribute to the world, and it's as simple as just sharing our thoughts. We'll have to see what comes out as a result.

Given I'm just getting started with this thing, expect there to be a good number of cosmetic changes in the near future.

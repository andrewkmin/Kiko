<p class="lead">There's a lot I want to talk about.</p>

Let's see...
* 2016-2018 MacBook Pro -- specifically re: touch bar and butterfly keyboard
* Good-to-knows and good-to-haves for using a macOS computer
* How I grew to greatly appreciate swimming this summer (health is wealth)
* Limited release sneakers have the greatest Sharpe ratio of all time (i.e. returns per volatility)
* Running reading list of blog posts, books, and tweets
* Favorite crypto projects
* Developing on the blockchain (Bitcoin and Ethereum)

Going to have to add to this moving forward.

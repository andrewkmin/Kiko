A bunch of miscellany

***

##### Photos
I've shot some things over the past couple years. I really thought DSLRs were cool for a while; 
started off with a neat little Sony A200, moved onto a Canon 60D with a very solid 17-55 mm f2.8 IS (not kit), the ever-so-handy , and now delegate all my photo taking to my handy iPhone.

Some notable trips: 
* Paris (2014)
* Cambodia (2015)
* Peru (2016)
* Seoul (2016)
* Beijing (2016)

##### Sneakers
I love sneakers. I got into them as a result of playing and watching basketball. My teammates would be rockin the latest heat, or at least know about it. Ray Allen was hoopin for the Sonics in crazy Jordan Brand player exclusives. Crowds would gather at the mall on Saturday mornings. I like to credit the shoe game for giving me my first taste of entrepreneurship and for allowing me to recognize firsthand the value of Facebook as a marketplace, through groups (before marketplace was an actual feature). Buy low, sell high -- the name of the game. Furthermore, thanks to the shoe game, I learned that code is power. 

##### Tech
A self-proclaimed Apple enthusiast, I've flipped my way into owning (and flipping) quite a few iDevices over time. The list includes the following:
* iPod nano 2g
* iPod nano 5g
* iPod classic 5g
* iPod touch 2g: first foray into jailbreaking, installing cydia, and SSHing into devices
* iPhone 2g: first software unlock experience; first cracked screen lol
* iPhone 3g: glossier; app store release; susceptible to dust penetration
* iPhone 3gs: significantly faster; video capability
* iPhone 4s: retina was incredible; antenna-gate resolved; groundbreaking design
* iPhone 5s: touch ID; chamfered edges; siri; GOAT form factor; typical incremental improvements
* iPhone 6: round; bigger screen; LTE; typical incremental improvements
* iPhone 7: hyped jet black; bye-bye 3.5mm, hello airpods; typical incremental improvements
* iPhone X: namegate (lol); face ID; edge-to-edge true-tone + notch; typical incremental improvements
* MacBook Pro mid-2010 base model 13": very usable; core 2 duo + 4gb ram = underpowered
* MacBook Pro mid-2014 base model 15": retina. display.; reliable workhorse; still swift
* MacBook early-2015 base model 12": underrated portability; lacking performance; excusable keyboard
* MacBook late-2016 base model 13": touch bar + usb-c just ok; butterfly v2 is solid; dope form factor
* Magic Mouse: clean aesthetic; not much more to it
* Magic Keyboard: clean aesthetic; solid key mechanics 
In retrospect, that's a crazy number of devices. The most notable, in my eyes, would be the 4s, 6, and X, and MBP '14.

The 4s was leaps and bounds better than the 3gs in literally every respect, unless you were one of the few that liked how the curvy 3g/3gs fit in the palm of your hand. The 4/4s was straight up industrial. The back panel was composed of glass, and replaceable/customizable. When the 4 first came out, I remember seeing it at the Apple Store and being amazed. Retina display tech was crazy lit. I loved the design. It made every other phone seem obsolete.
